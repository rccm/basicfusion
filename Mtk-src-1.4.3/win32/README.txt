This directory contains a binary version of MISR Toolkit version 1.4.2 for Windows.

This software was built on Microsoft Windows XP 32-bit using Microsoft Visual C++ 2008.  It has been tested with Python 2.7 and IDL 8.2.

The binaries depend on the following libraries which are included in this package for your convenience.
 
    ZLIB library (version 1.2.5) 
    JPEG library (version 6b) (.lib only)
    SZIP library (version 2.1)  *Encoder ENABLED*
    HDF library (version 4.2r6)
    HDF-EOS library (version 2.18)
    TRE library (version 0.7.5)

To use the Windows IDL binaries requires IDL 8.2 (32-bit).
Note: the 32-bit IDL dll's will NOT load in 64-bit IDL. Use the 32-bit IDL that was installed alongside the 64-bit version.
