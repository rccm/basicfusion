This documentation was created by running /path/to/Python-2.3.7/Doc/tools/mkhowto --html --pdf pymtk.tex in the main doc directory.
Please do not make changes to this directory but instead make changes to the latex pymtk.tex
If you need to rebuild the doc you can obtain the mkhowto script within the Doc/tools directory of the full Python source distributions up to and including version 2.5.
This script was removed in 2.6 when python changed from LaTeX documention to RST (reStructuredText).
